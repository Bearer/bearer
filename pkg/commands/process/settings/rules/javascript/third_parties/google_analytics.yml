    ## Description

    Leaking sensitive data to third-party analytics tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Google Analytics.

    ## Remediations

    When sending data to analytics libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.

    If you really need to identify users, use unique identifiers from the database.

    ```javascript
      gtag("event", "screen_view", {
        user: {
          subscribed: true,
        },
      });
    ```
