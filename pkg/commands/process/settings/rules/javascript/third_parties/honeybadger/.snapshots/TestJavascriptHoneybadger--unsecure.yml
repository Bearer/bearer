        title: Sensitive data sent to Honeybadger detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Leaking sensitive data to third-party error logging tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Honeybadger.

            ## Remediations

            When sending data to logging libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.

            If you really need to identify users, use unique identifiers from the database.

            ```javascript
              const Honeybadger = require("@honeybadger-io/js");

              let context = { user: { uuid: "aacd05fd-8f5b-4bc6-aa8b-35e5fbf37325" } };

              Honeybadger.setContext(context);
            ```
