    ## Description

    Leaking sensitive data to loggers is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to loggers.

    ## Remediations

    ❌ Avoid using sensitive data in logger messages:

    ```javascript
    logger.info(`User is: ${user.email}`)
    ```

    ✅ If you need to identify a user, ensure to use their unique identifier instead of their personal identifiable information:

    ```javascript
    logger.info(`User is: ${user.uuid}`)
    ```
