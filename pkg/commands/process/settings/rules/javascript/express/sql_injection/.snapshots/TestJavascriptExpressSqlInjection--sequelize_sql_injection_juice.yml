        title: SQL injection vulnerability detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Including unsanitized data, such as user input or request data, in raw SQL queries makes your application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

            ## Remediations

            ❌ Avoid raw queries, especially those that contain unsanitized user input

            ```javascript
              var sqlite = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:");
              sqlite.query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE ID = " + req.params.userId);
            ```

            Instead, consider the following approaches when writing SQL queries

            ✅ Validate query input wherever possible

            ```javascript
              var rawId = req.params.userId
              if !(/[0-9]+/.test(rawId)) {
                // input is unexpected; don't make the query
              }
            ```

            ✅ Use prepared (or parameterized) statements when querying

            Sequelize example -
            ```javascript
              var sqlite = new Sequelize("sqlite::memory:");
              sqlite.query(
                "SELECT * FROM users WHERE ID = ?",
                { replacements: [req.params.userId] },
                type: sequelize.QueryTypes.SELECT
              )
            ```
