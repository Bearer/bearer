        title: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability detected.
        description: |
            ## Description
            Sending unsanitized user input in a response puts your application at risk of cross-site scripting attacks.


            ## Remediations
            ‚ùå Avoid including user input directly in a response:

            ```javascript
            res.send(req.body.data)
            ```
