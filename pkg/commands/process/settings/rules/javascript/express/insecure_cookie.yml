    ## Description
    To make sure cookies don't open your application up to exploits or unauthorized access, don't use default cookie values and make sure to set security options appropriately.

    ## Remediations
    - Instead of the default cookie name, use generic names.
    - Set cookie security values to use HTTP(S) instead of client-side javascript.
    - Set `secure` values to `true` to force cookies to only send over HTTPS.
