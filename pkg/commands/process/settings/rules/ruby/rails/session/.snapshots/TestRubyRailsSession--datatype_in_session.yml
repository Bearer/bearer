        title: Sensitive data stored in a session cookie detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Sensitive data should not be stored in session cookies. This policy looks for any sensitive data stored within the session cookies.

            ## Remediations
            By default, [Rails uses a Cookie based session store](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-storage). This makes it unsafe if you use it to store sensitive data in addition of making invalidating cookies difficult as they are stored on the client.

            âœ… To ensure session's data stays safe, ensure to use a database-based session storage, which is easily done though Rails configuration:

            ```ruby
            Rails.application.config.session_store :active_record_store
            ```
