    ## Description
    Rails uses the same actions for both GET and HEAD requests. When creating
    actions that handle both GET and state altering verbs (eg. POST), the use
    of `request.get?` can lead to unexpected state changes.

    ### Remediations

    ✅ Use separate action logic for GET and POST

    ✅ Check for state altering verbs rather than GET:

    ```ruby
    if request.post?
      alter_state
    end
    ```
