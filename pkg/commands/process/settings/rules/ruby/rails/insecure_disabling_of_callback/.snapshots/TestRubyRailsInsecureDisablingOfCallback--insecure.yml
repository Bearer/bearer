            ## Description
            When using except/unless for disabling a callback, there is a high chance
            of skipping important access control logic by accident.

            ### Remediations

            âœ… Prefer enumerating all of the actions using `only`:

            ```ruby
            skip_before_action :access_control, only: %i[public_action1 public_action2]
            ```
