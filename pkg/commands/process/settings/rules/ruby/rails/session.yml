    ## Description

    Sensitive data should not be stored in session cookies. This policy looks for any sensitive data stored within the session cookies.

    ## Remediations
    By default, [Rails uses a Cookie based session store](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#session-storage). This makes it unsafe if you use it to store sensitive data in addition of making invalidating cookies difficult as they are stored on the client.

    ✅ To ensure session's data stays safe, ensure to use a database-based session storage, which is easily done though Rails configuration:

    ```ruby
    Rails.application.config.session_store :active_record_store
    ```
