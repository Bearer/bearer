            ## Description

            Storing sensitive data in cookies can lead to a data breach. This rule looks for instances where sensitive data is stored in browser cookies.

            ## Remediations

            ❌ Avoid storing sensitive data in unencrypted cookies messages:

            ```ruby
            cookies[:user_email] = "john@doe.com"
            ```

            ✅ To ensure cookie data stays safe, use encrypted cookies:

            ```ruby
            cookies.encrypted[:user_email] = "john@doe.com"
            ```
