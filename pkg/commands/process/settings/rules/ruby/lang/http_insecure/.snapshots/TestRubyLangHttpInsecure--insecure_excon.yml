            ## Description

            Applications should only connect to API using HTTPS connections. This rule checks that all HTTP connections use HTTPS.

            ## Remediations

            ❌ Avoid using unsecured outgoing HTTP communication, especially in the context of API calls:

            ```ruby
            response = HTTParty.get('http://insecure-api.com')
            ```

            ✅ Ensure to always connect though HTTPS:

            ```ruby
            response = HTTParty.get('https://secure-api.com')
            ```
