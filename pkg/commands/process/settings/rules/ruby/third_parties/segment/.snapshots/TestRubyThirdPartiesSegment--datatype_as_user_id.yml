            ## Description
            Leaking sensitive data to third-party analytics tools is a common cause of data leaks and can lead to data breaches. This rule looks for instances of sensitive data sent to Segment.

            ## Remediations

            When sending data to analytics libraries, ensure all sensitive data is removed.
