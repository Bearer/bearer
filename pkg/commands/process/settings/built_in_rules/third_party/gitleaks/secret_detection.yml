    ## Description

    Hard-coding secrets in a project opens them up to leakage. This rule checks for common secret types such as keys, tokens, and passwords using the popular Gitleaks library and ensures they aren't hard-coded.

    ## Remediations

    Do not hard-code secrets in committed code. Instead, use environment variables and a secret management system.
