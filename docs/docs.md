# Curio

Welcome to the Curio documentation. Curio is a static code analysis tool (SAST) dedicated to data security. It scans your source code to [discover sensitive data](/explanations/discovery-and-classification) flows (PHI, PII, PD as well as Data stores, internal and external APIs) and data security risks (leaks, missing encryption, third-party sharing etc).

## Getting started

New to Curio? Check out the [quickstart](/quickstart/) to scan your first project. 

Ready to dive in? Curio's [reports](/explanations/reports/) are your path to analyzing data security risks in your application. Check the [supported languages](/reference/supported-languages/), then view the [command reference](/reference/commands/) to configure Curio to your needs.


## Explanations

Explanations dive into the rational behind Curio and explain some of its heavier concepts.

- [How Curio discovers and classifies data](/explanations/discovery-and-classification/)
- [Curio's report types](/explanations/reports/)

## Reference

Reference documents are where you'll find detailed information about each command, as well as support charges for languages, policies, datatypes, and more.
