# Bearer

Welcome to the Bearer documentation. Bearer is a static code analysis tool (SAST) dedicated to data security. It scans your source code to [discover sensitive data](/explanations/discovery-and-classification) flows (PHI, PII, PD as well as Data stores, internal and external APIs) and data security risks (leaks, missing encryption, third-party sharing etc).

## Getting started

New to Bearer? Check out the [quickstart](/quickstart/) to scan your first project. 

Ready to dive in? Bearer's [reports](/explanations/reports/) are your path to analyzing data security risks in your application. Check the [supported languages](/reference/supported-languages/), then view the [command reference](/reference/commands/) to configure Bearer to your needs.

## Guides
