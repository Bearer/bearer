# Bearer

Welcome to the Bearer documentation. Bearer is a static application security testing (SAST) tool that scans your source code and analyzes your [data flows](/explanations/discovery-and-classification) to discover, filter and prioritize security risks and vulnerabilities leading to [sensitive data](/reference/datatypes/) exposures (PII, PHI, PD).

We provides [built-in rules](/reference/rules) against a common set of security risks and vulnerabilities, known as [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/). Here are some practical examples of what those rules look for:
- Leakage of sensitive data through cookies, internal loggers, third-party logging services, and into analytics environments.
- Usage of weak encryption libraries or misusage of encryption algorithms.
- Unencrypted incoming and outgoing communication (HTTP, FTP, SMTP) of sensitive information.
- Non-filtered user input.
- Hard-coded secrets and tokens.

And [many more](/reference/rules).

Bearer currenty supporting **JavaScript** and **Ruby** stacks, more will follow.

## Getting started

New to Bearer? Check out the [quickstart](/quickstart/) to scan your first project. 

Ready to dive in? Bearer's [scanners](/explanations/scanners/) and [reports](/explanations/reports/) are your path to analyzing security risks and vulnerabilities in your application. Check the [command reference](/reference/commands/) to configure Bearer to your needs.
