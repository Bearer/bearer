# Curio

Welcome to the Curio documentation. Curio is a static code analysis tool (SAST) dedicated to data security. It scans your source code to discover sensitive data flows (PHI, PII, PD as well as Data stores, internal and external APIs) and data security risks (leaks, missing encryption, third-party sharing etc).
