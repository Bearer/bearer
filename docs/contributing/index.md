## Best practices

Here are some tips to get you started:

- If you're unfamiliar with the process, check out GitHub's guide: [Creating a pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)
- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) when creating a pull request.
- As a best practice, we encourage you to [sign your commits](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits). We require our core contributors to sign their commits.
