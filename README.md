# Curio: The data-first security scanner that finds risks and vulnerabilities in your code to protect sensitive data

Curio is a static code analysis tool (SAST) that scans your source code to discover security risks and vulnerabilities that put your sensitive data at risk (PHI, PD, PII, Financial data).

[Explore the docs](https://curio.sh) - [Getting Started](#rocket-getting-started) - [FAQ](#question-faqs) - [Report Bug](https://github.com/Bearer/curio/issues/new/choose) - [Discord Community][discord]

```
Scanning target... 100% [===============] (7481/7481, 22 files/s) [5m44s]

Policy Report

=====================================
Policy list:

- Logger leaking
- Application level encryption missing

=====================================

SUCCESS

2 policies were run and no breaches were detected.

```

Curio helps developers and security teams to:

- Protect their application from leaking sensitive data (*loggers, cookies, third-parties, etc*.)
- Protect their application from having their sensitive data breached (*missing encryption, insecure communication, SQL injection, etc.*)
- Monitor sensitive data flows across every component (*Data stores, internal and external APIs*)

Curio is Open Source ([*see license*](#mortar_board-license)), and is built to be fully customizable, from creating your own policies, to adding custom code detectors up to enriching our data classifiers.

Curio also powers [Bearer](https://www.bearer.com), the developer-first platform to proactively find and fix data security risks and vulnerabilities across your development lifecycle

## :rocket: Getting started

Scan your first project in X minutes or less.

### Installation

Curio is available as a standalone executable binary. The latest release is available on the [releases tab](https://github.com/Bearer/curio/releases/latest), or use one of the methods below.

#### Install Script

:warning: **Not working till public** :warning:

This script downloads the Curio binary automatically based on your OS and architecture.

```bash
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bearer/curio/main/contrib/install.sh | sh
```

_Defaults to `./bin` as a bin directory and to the latest releases_

If you need to customize the options, use the following to pass parameters:

```bash
curl -sfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bearer/curio/main/contrib/install.sh | sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

#### Binary

Download the archive file for your operating system/architecture from [here](https://github.com/Bearer/curio/releases/latest/). Unpack the archive, and put the binary somewhere in your $PATH (on UNIX-y systems, /usr/local/bin or the like). Make sure it has permission to execute:

```bash
chmod +x ./curio
```

### Scan your project

Run `curio scan` on a project directory:

```bash
curio scan /path/to/your_project
```

or a single a file:

```bash
curio scan ./curio-ci-test/Pipfile.lock
```

<!-- TODO: insert sample output or video here -->

Additional options for using and configuring the `scan` command can be found in the [scan documentation](https://curio.sh/reference/commands/#scan).

## :question: FAQs

### What can I do with Curio?

The number one thing you can do with Curio is protect sensitive data processed by your applications from being exposed by identifying associated risks. Add Curio to your CI/CD and catch data breach and data leak risks early. This is the **Policy feature.**

Curio also helps your Compliance & Privacy team assess sensitive data flows processed through your applications, allowing them to comply with the growing number of data regulations across the World (*GDPR, CCPA, CPRA, LGPD, PIPA, HIPAA, etc.*). This is the **Data Flow Report**.

### Supported Language

Curio currently fully supports Ruby, while JavaScript/TypeScript support is coming soon. Additional languages listed below are supported only for the Data Flow Report features for now.

| Languages | Data Flow Report | Policy |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Ruby | ✅ | ✅ |
| JavaScript / TS | ✅ | Coming soon |
| PHP | ✅ | Coming later |
| Java | ✅ | Coming later |
| C# | ✅ | Coming later |
| Go | ✅ | Coming later |
| Python | ✅ | Coming later |

In addition, Curio also supports these common structured data file formats:

| Format | Support |
| --- | --- |
| SQL | ✅ |
| OpenAPI | ✅ |
| GraphQL | ✅ |
| Protobuf | ✅ |

### What is sensitive data?

Out of the box, Curio supports 120+ data types, ranging from Personal Data (PD), to Personal Identifiable Information (PII), Protected Health Information (PHI), and Financial Data. Please refer to the [data types documentation](https://curio.sh/reference/datatypes/) for the complete list of supported data types and how the classification works.

You can also add new data types, change the overall taxonomy, or update the classifiers to support custom use-cases (guide coming soon).

### When to use Curio?

As we often say, security shouldn’t be an afterthought. Curio is Open Source to allow any company, of any size, to start a more secure journey and protect their customer's data in the best way possible. Today is a good day to start!

### Who is using Curio?

Curio is used by developers and app sec engineers, and has been built as part of
Bearer with some of the best tech companies in the world to help them protect highly sensitive data.


What if you don't process sensitive data? Well, that's pretty rare these days. Even if you discover no usage after a one-time scan, Curio is a great addition to your CI tooling to ensure sensitive data processing isn't introduced into your codebase without your knowledge.

### How is it different from X solution?

Static code analysis tools for security are not new and many great solutions exist including Snyk Code, CodeQL, Semgrep, SonarQube, Brakeman, etc.

Curio is different as it emphasizes that the most important asset we need to protect today is sensitive data, not “systems.” At the same time, it’s built with the knowledge that developers are not security experts and can’t dedicate more time to fix a growing number of security issues without a clear prioritization and understanding of the impact.

By putting the **focus on sensitive data first**, Curio is able to trigger security risks and vulnerabilities that are by design top priority, with much less noise.

The spirit of Curio is the less (alerts) is more (security) philosophy.
