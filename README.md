Bearer CLI scans your source code for:
* **Security risks and vulnerabilities** using [built-in rules](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/) covering the [OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/) and [CWE Top 25](https://cwe.mitre.org/top25/archive/2023/2023_top25_list.html), such as:
  * A01: Access control (e.g. Path Traversal, Open Redirect, Exposure of Sensitive Information).
  * A02: Cryptographic Failures (e.g. Weak Algorithm, Insecure Communication).
  * A03: Injection (e.g. SQL Injection, Input Validation, XSS, XPath).
  * A04: Design (e.g. Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data, Persistent Cookies Containing Sensitive Information).
  * A05: Security Misconfiguration (e.g. Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in a Cookie or JWT).
  * A07: Identification and Authentication Failures (e.g. Use of Hard-coded Password, Improper Certificate Validation).
  * A08: Data Integrity Failures (e.g. Deserialization of Untrusted Data).
  * A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures (e.g. Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File).
  * A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).

  *Note: all the rules and their code patterns are accessible through the [documentation](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/).*

* **Privacy risks** with the ability to detect [sensitive data flow](https://docs.bearer.com/explanations/discovery-and-classification/) such as the use of PII, PHI in your app, and [components](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/recipes/) processing sensitive data (e.g. databases like pgSQL, third-party APIs such as OpenAI, Sentry, etc.). This helps generate a [privacy report](https://docs.bearer.com/guides/privacy/) relevant for:
  * Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA).
  * Data Protection Impact Assessment (DPIA).
  * Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) input for GDPR compliance reporting.

### Scan your project

The easiest way to try out Bearer CLI is with the OWASP [Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) example project. It simulates a realistic JavaScript application with common security flaws. Clone or download it to a convenient location to get started.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop.git
```

Now, run the scan command with `bearer scan` on the project directory:

```bash
bearer scan juice-shop
```

A progress bar will display the status of the scan.

Once the scan is complete, Bearer CLI will output, by default, a security report with details of any rule findings, as well as where in the codebase the infractions happened and why.

By default the `scan` command use the SAST scanner, other [scanner types](https://docs.bearer.com/explanations/scanners) are available.

### Analyze the report

The security report is an easily digestible view of the security issues detected by Bearer CLI. A report is made up of:

* The list of [rules](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/) run against your code.
* Each detected finding, containing the file location and lines that triggered the rule finding.
* A stat section with a summary of rules checks, findings and warnings.

The [OWASP Juice Shop](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop) example application will trigger rule findings and output a full report. Here's a section of the output:

```text
...
HIGH: Sensitive data stored in HTML local storage detected. [CWE-312]
https://docs.bearer.com/reference/rules/javascript_lang_session
To skip this rule, use the flag --skip-rule=javascript_lang_session

File: juice-shop/frontend/src/app/login/login.component.ts:102

 102       localStorage.setItem('email', this.user.email)


=====================================

59 checks, 40 findings

CRITICAL: 0
HIGH: 16 (CWE-22, CWE-312, CWE-798, CWE-89)
MEDIUM: 24 (CWE-327, CWE-548, CWE-79)
LOW: 0
WARNING: 0
```

In addition of the security report, you can also run a [privacy report](https://docs.bearer.com/explanations/reports/#privacy-report).

## :question: FAQs

### What makes Bearer CLI different from any other SAST tools?

SAST tools are known to bury security teams and developers under hundreds of issues with little context and no sense of priority, often requiring security analysts to triage issues manually.

The most vulnerable asset today is sensitive data, so we start there and [prioritize](https://github.com/Bearer/bearer/issues/728) findings by assessing sensitive data flows to highlight what is more critical, and what is not. This unique ability allows us to provide you with a privacy scanner too.

We believe that by linking security issues with a clear business impact and risk of a data breach, or data leak, we can build better and more robust software, at no extra cost.

In addition, by being Free and Open, extendable by design, and built with a great developer UX in mind, we bet you will see the difference for yourself.

### What is the privacy scanner?

In addition of detecting security flaws in your code, Bearer CLI allows you to automate the evidence gathering process needed to generate a privacy report for your compliance team.

When you run Bearer CLI on your codebase, it discovers and classifies data by identifying patterns in the source code. Specifically, it looks for data types and matches against them. Most importantly, it never views the actual values—it just can’t—but only the code itself. If you want to learn more, here is the [longer explanation](https://docs.bearer.com/explanations/discovery-and-classification/).

Bearer CLI is able to identify over 120+ data types from sensitive data categories such as Personal Data (PD), Sensitive PD, Personally identifiable information (PII), and Personal Health Information (PHI). You can view the full list in the [supported data types documentation](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/datatypes/).

Finally, Bearer CLI also lets you detect components storing and processing sensitive data such as databases, internal APIs, and third-party APIs. See the [recipe list](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/recipes/) for a complete list of components.

### Supported Language

Bearer CLI currently supports:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>GA</td>
    <td>JavaScript/TypeScript, Ruby, PHP, Java</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Beta</td>
    <td>Go</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Alpha</td>
    <td>Python</td>
  </tr>
</table>

[Learn more](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/supported-languages/) about language support.

### How long does it take to scan my code? Is it fast?

It depends on the size of your applications. It can take as little as 20 seconds, up to a few minutes for an extremely large code base.

As a rule of thumb, Bearer CLI should never take more time than running your test suite.

In the case of CI integration, we provide a diff scan solution to make it even faster. [Learn more](https://docs.bearer.com/guides/configure-scan/#only-report-new-findings-on-a-branch).

### What about false positives?

If you’re familiar with SAST tools, false positives are always a possibility.

By using the most modern static code analysis techniques and providing a native filtering and prioritizing solution on the most important issues, we believe we have dramatically improved the overall SAST experience.

We strive to provide the best possible experience for our users. [Learn more](https://docs.bearer.com/reference/supported-languages/#how-do-we-evaluate-language-support%3F) about how we achieve this.

### When and where to use Bearer CLI?

We recommend running Bearer CLI in your CI to check new PRs automatically for security issues, so your development team has a direct feedback loop to fix issues immediately.

You can also integrate Bearer CLI in your CD, though we recommend setting it to only fail on high criticality issues, as the impact for your organization might be important.

In addition, running Bearer CLI as a scheduled job is a great way to keep track of your security posture and make sure new security issues are found even in projects with low activity.

Make sure to read our [integration strategy guide](https://docs.bearer.com/guides/integration-strategy/) for more information.
