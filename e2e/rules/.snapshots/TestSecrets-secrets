        title: Hard-coded secret detected.
        description: |
            ## Description

            Hard-coding secrets in a project opens them up to leakage. This rule checks for common secret types such as keys, tokens, and passwords using the popular Gitleaks library and ensures they aren't hard-coded.

            ## Remediations

            Do not hard-code secrets in committed code. Instead, use environment variables and a secret management system.
