## Basics

If you've discovered a bug or thing you have and aren't sure how to fix it, [open an issue](https://github.com/Bearer/curio/issues/new/choose) with details on how to recreate the problem.

## Development

Curio is written in [Go](https://www.go.dev), so you'll need golang v1.19 or greater installed. Installation instructions for your architecture can be found at [golang downloads page](https://go.dev/dl/).

Next, confirm the installation by running the following command:

```bash
go version
```

You should receive a response with the installed version and architecture.

### Installing Curio

[Fork and clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) the repository locally using your preferred method. For example:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bearer/curio.git
```

Next, navigate into the curio project in your terminal, and install the required go modules:

```bash
go mod download
```

### Running Curio locally from source

To run Curio from source use the following command from the curio directory:

```bash
go run ./cmd/curio/main.go [COMMAND]
```
Use commands and flags as normal in place of `[COMMAND]`.


## Testing

Run all tests:

``` shell
go test ./...
```

Running classification tests:

```bash
go test ./pkg/classification/... -count=1
```

Running a single specific test:

```bash
go test -run ^TestSchema$ ./pkg/classification/schema -count=1
```

### Integration testing

These tests work by running an instance of the Curio application, with a
specified set of arguments, and then capturing the standard output and standard
error streams. The captured output is compared against a snapshot of the
expected output, using the [cupaloy](https://github.com/bradleyjkemp/cupaloy)
library.

The standard pattern is to create test case(s) using the
`testhelper.NewTestCase` factory function, and then pass these into the
`testhelper.RunTests` function for execution.

Integration tests are grouped within the top-level
[`integration`](/integration) subdirectory; see the existing tests for examples
to follow when adding a new test.

To update snapshots, set the `UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS` env variable to `true` when running a test. For example:

```bash
UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=true go test ./...
```

## Generating CLI Documentation

Curio's reference pages are built, in-part, by files created from the CLI source. Whenever updating CLI commands or flags, it's best to rerun the generator below and include the created files in your PR. Upon a new doc build, the docs website will reflect these changes.

From the root of the project run:

```bash
go run ./scripts/gen-doc-yaml.go
```

This will auto generate yaml files for any updated CLI arguments.

## Submitting your changes as a pull request
